Redrawism focuses on two-components of art creation, and the way they work together, not in any order. The two
components are:
* doing, making a change. Could be making a brush stroke, adding a note, changing a colour, iterating an algorithm,
soldering a piece
* assessing the change according to a source. Assessing means to decide whether the change is closer to or further from
an ideal, and to use that information to decide what the next doing step should be. The ideal can be an impression,
a source image, a live view
