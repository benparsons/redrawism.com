Redrawism focuses on two-components of art creation, and the way they work together, not in any order. The two
components are:
* doing, making a change. Could be making a brush stroke, adding a note, changing a colour, iterating an algorithm,
soldering a piece
* assessing the change according to a source. Assessing means to decide whether the change is closer to or further from
an ideal, and to use that information to decide what the next doing step should be. The ideal can be an impression,
a source image, a live view, a feeling

Draws attention to the process. This is especially important in an ere when people flippantly say "well this is just
done on a computer" (what was done?) or "well you can do anything with Photoshop" (who can?) It is important to
highlight that in all art there is a sequence of doing and assessing - software allows us to more easily see the
separation.

All creation fits this, with very few exceptions. Even seemingly unthinking creation has at least the one each of the
components: first assessing the "zero" point (a blank canvas, an existing wall), then making a change. Even if the
result is not assessed, we have performed both components.

"genredraw" makes changes and then compares the result of those changes to a source, if dissatisfied it makes another
change to revert. The criteria it uses to assess the "ideal" is pixel-similarity to a source image. The only criteria
we have given the algorithm is a mathematical one which does not assume any sense of aesthetics. There is a large
requirement for human intervention.
