<strong>Redrawism</strong> is a generative art form, which posits that the process of art creation is an art form in itself. Redrawism algorithmically deconstructs the process of artistic creation into two non-sequential, iterative components: Action and Assessment.
</p>
<p>
Action: <em>making a change</em>. A brush stroke, a stitch, the addition of a note, the soldering of a piece, the changing of a colour, are all examples of Action.
</p>
<p>
Assessment: <em>comparison against the Ideal</em>. To assess is to decide whether the change has resulted in progress towards, or away from the Ideal, and to decide what the next action should be. The Ideal can be an absolute reference such as a source image or photograph, or as ethereal as a sense, a feeling, an emotional response or desired reaction.
</p>
<p>
The process of creation entails thousands of minute Assessments and Actions, combining to produce an artwork which mimics the artist’s Ideal. Even the seemingly spontaneous creation involves at least one of each components – assessing the “zero” point (a blank canvas, an empty screen, a spinning pottery wheel), then responding to the Assessment with Action.

Redrawism explores the process of artistic creation by automating the iterative process of Action &amp; Assessment. Redrawism uses mathematical algorithms to replicate the process of creation towards a defined Ideal, which is a fixed source image. The algorithm makes changes, then compares the result of those changes to the Ideal. If dissatisfied, the algorithm continues to make changes. The only criteria the algorithm is given is a mathematical one of pixel-similarity to the source image, unrestricted by the human limitations of aesthetic sense and perception.</p>
